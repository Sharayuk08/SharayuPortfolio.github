								<div class="image main"><img src="images/From Dreams to Reality.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am a detail-oriented, responsible aspiring data analyst. As a recent graduate with a Master of Science degree in Information Technology and Management from the University of Texas at Dallas, I am eager to begin my career as a data analyst. </p>
								<p>I’m passionate about transforming data into clear, compelling visuals that would help to make informed decisions. My academic and project experiences have provided me with a robust foundation and hands-on experience in statistical and data analysis, storytelling and data visualization with SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel. As a fast learner and someone with a student mentality, I am open to continuous learning and seeking opportunities to further expand my skills and expertise in data analytics. As a quick learner, adaptability is one of my strengths, enabling me to quickly grasp new tools and technologies as needed.</p>
								<p>I have a foundation in marketing with opportunities to work in a couple of companies as a marketing assistant after graduating with a bachelor’s degree in business administration from University of Toledo, Ohio. During this period, I realized and grew interest towards the integration of technology in various business operations.</p>
								<p>I am now seeking an entry-level data analyst position where I can apply my analytical skills while contributing towards the organization goals. I am a spontaneous learner seeking new opportunities and exploring data sets to learn and grow. I am excited to bring my enthusiasm to a dynamic team.</p>
